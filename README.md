# Election Audit using Python and VS Code

## **Overview of Project**
Assisting a Colorado Board of Election employee, Tom, in an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. The main task is to report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote. Data processing is usually done in Excel; however, Tom wanted to know whether there is a way to automate the process using Python. 

### Purpose
Specifically, the purpose of this analysis is to create and run a Python script using a VS Code for election data analysis and complete the following tasks: 

1. Calculate the total votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of counties which received votes. 
3. Calculate the voter turnout for each county.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
5. Determine the county with the highest turnout.
6. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes. 
7. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
8. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
9. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.



## **Analysis**

Software: Python 3..6.7? Visual studio Code 1.38.1

Refactored and original VBA script can be found here:

### Stock Performance and execution time using the Original VBA Code

## **Summary**
Stock performance is the same for the year 2018 regardless of the VBA code used. As per the execution times, the VBA script seems to run slightly faster using the original VBA script. 
In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
